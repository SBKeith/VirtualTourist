# VirtualTourist

This app allows users to select any location on a map, and build a persistent photo album (via Flikr) for said location.

Persistent data (via Core Data) includes:  Map drop pins and photos.  Photos are associated to the appropriate pins (aka these are photo albums).


NSUserDefaults includes: Center of map and zoom level.  This adjusts based on the user's most recent setting.
